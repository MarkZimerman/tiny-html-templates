# HTML Lab

A collection of **ultra-lightweight, standalone HTML templates** for quick experiments, learning, and browser testing.  
Every page is a single self-contained `.html` file — no build tools, no bundlers, no project setup.

This project is perfect for:

- Writing small reproducible code examples  
- Testing HTML/CSS/JS behavior in isolation  
- Playing with Mocha/Chai tests in the browser  
- Quick debugging or prototyping  
- Teaching or experimenting with web fundamentals
